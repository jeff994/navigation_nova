Driving logic: 

For each step of encoder data received 
	if no more job left in queue
		return 
	check the currenct job
		if the mission is a turning job 
			set on_mission indicator if it's not set 
			then perofrm turn 
			if the angle turn accumalted equal or greater than required angle  
				issue signal current job completed
				de-set on_mission indicator
				delelte the current job 
			else 
				if on_misson set
					continue for next step
				else
					command robot to rotate 
		if the mission is a moving job
			set on_mission indicator if it's not set 
			drive forward
			calculate the distance run for this step 
			if the distance accumlated equal or greater than required angle 
				issue signal current job completed
				delete current job
				de-set on_mission indicator
			else 
				if on_mission set
					continue for the next step 
				else 
					command robot to move
